# Windows-Shell-Optimizer

## GOAL

The script aims at cleaning and optimizing the Windows Start Menu, and the
Windows Shell explorer. It is composed of 4 modules:
- CleanStartMenuItem: Copy and remove manufacturer folder from the AllUsers
Start Menu to the user start menu
- CleanApps: Remove (and Reset if enabled) useless OEM Windows 10 Apps
- RegistryChanges: Clean explorer contextual menu, namespaces, navigation pane,
etc.
- RegistryCommandStore: Remove useless buttons from the File Explorer Command store.
WARNING: DO NOT ENABLE THIS MODULE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Indeed, 
no script has been developped to restaure these settings.

All these modules can be disabled/enabled in the Settings file. Each item can be
disabled/enabled individually and some new items can be of course added.
Since the script will translate everything from english to the targeted machine
display language, all settings must be in english language.
